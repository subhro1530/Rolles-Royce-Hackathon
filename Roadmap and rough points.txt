Problem: Overpopulation and transport negligence...

1. Reduce toll tax by using less labours and more of AI.
2. Introduce AI in transport sector by identifying each vehicle and noting up their aadhar details.
3. Storing data of license plate and linking it with user's aadhar card.
4. Simplifying the process of faulty driving fee with the eradication of chalans by directly imposing penalties on the user of the vehicle 
and deducting the penalty directly from the bank account. 
5. Introducing disaster relief by getting the info  about the user through a website which shall store the details of the user across.
6. Introducing modern technologies and using CCTV for viewing number plates and storing the information of a driver at a particular place.
7. Cameras should be programmed as to detect only clear license plate (will call it: lp-cameras).
8. The lisence plates must introduce a non-removable QR system which when scanned by the lp-cameras.

basically I plan to merge aadhar , lisence and a person.
